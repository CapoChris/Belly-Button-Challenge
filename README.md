# Belly-Button-Challenge

This project involved working with a JSON dataset containing microbial data collected from human navels. The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore individual samples through a dropdown menu. Once a sample is selected, the app displays detailed metadata and generates two visualizations:

A bubble chart showing the quantity of each Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) present in the selected sample

A bar chart highlighting the top 10 most abundant OTUs within that sample

This tool provides an accessible way to analyze microbial diversity and distribution across various individuals, combining data parsing with dynamic visualization techniques.
